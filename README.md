## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/nskhalsa/website/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nskhalsa/website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## About Me
I am currently a senior undergraduate in the BS Fisheries and Ocean Sciences program at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). I will be joining the Chen lab at the University of Maine (UMO) in Orono to pursue graduate school in marine biology as an NSF graduate research fellow in the fall of 2020. Since my time at UAF, I have participated in a multitude of diverse research projects ranging from mapping the overwintering distribution of juvenile Chinook salmon, to characterizing the habitat preferences of nearshore Arctic fishes. I have utilized a diverse array of techniques in my research such as environmental DNA (eDNA) and _in-situ_ oceanographic instrumentation. My current research interests broadly lie in understanding how future ocean change will affect the productivity and sustainability of living marine resources, and the socioeconomic sustainability of communities which rely on them. I am passionate about using data to confront ecological models for testing hypotheses, and using knowledge generated to inform resource management.
